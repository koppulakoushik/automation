# The rest of your original script goes here...
# Hereâ€™s a summary of what it does:
#
# 1. Downloads the latest JDK release from the GitHub API based on version.
# 2. Downloads and extracts the JDK archive.
# 3. Imports necessary certificates into the JDK's truststore.
# 4. Compresses the new JDK version and uploads it to Artifactory.

# Example of a simplified JDK download logic, with version and flavor:
# (You should have your original logic here for downloading, extracting, and cert import)
